<p id="description">This is a basic calculator application built with modern web technologies and using the Shunting Yard algorithm to carry out calculations. It supports the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo

Additionally, it can handle decimal numbers and exponential numbers.</p>

## üöÄDemo

You can access the live demo of the calculator @ [https://calculator-hargent.netlify.app/](https://calculator-hargent.netlify.app/)


## Features

- **Shunting Yard Algorithm**: Utilizes the Shunting Yard algorithm for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions efficiently.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
- **Decimal and Exponential Numbers**: Capable of handling decimal and exponential numbers for precise calculations.
- **Theme Switch**: Implements a theme switch functionality to toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Built with Vite TypeScript**: Developed using Vite, a fast build tool for web development, with TypeScript for type safety.
